# LithFix Beta 1

---

This is a beta version of lithfix. This is intended as a global fix for various aging issues in LithTech engine games. Currently releases are made for individual games.

Remove any custom rez files you have enabled, and add in "-rez lithfix" to your advanced command line in the launcher. (Don't include the quotes!)

## NOLF - REVIVAL RELEASE


This uses the `WidescreenGOTY` patch as a base, and basically replaces lithtech.exe code to fix things like mouse look, and add a framerate limiter.

## SHOGO - GOG.COM RELEASE

This uses the base Shogo DLLs as a base. Fixes up mouse look, and adds a frame limiter.

---

This should be speedrunner friendly, as it won't change any RNG/randomness/broken things that break as you expect them.
Enjoy!
